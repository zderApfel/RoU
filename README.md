# Rage of the Urbanites - The ACAB FPS

It is 2054.

Due to a catastrophic failure in 2032 to regulate the global temperature via an experimental weather machine, Earth has now entered a new ice age. 

In the early years of the ice age, many nations around the world buckled under the new threat. Most survivors from the Global South (who were able to) had to migrate due to the worsened famine and instability, until they eventually became frozen wastelands devoid of most life. The first world nations survived mostly unscathed. However, the ticking time bomb that was the United States eventually burst. 

The nation's simmering alt-right plague came to a head when agitators joined forces with militias and high-ranking military officers, as well as other elected officials to forcibly coup the entire American government, instilling a new fascist regime called Neopublicans. Their first act was to rename the nation to the Republic of America, and replaced all state governments with cronies of their own given the power to rule with impunity.

The police forces, as expected, got worse as a result, with police brutality practically made legal against the ever larger poverty class.

You play as a disillusioned anarchist who recently lost their closest friend to a murder by one of these emboldened police officers. Through events I don't want to spoil, you decide to start a militia of their own and bring the power back to the people. 

# Gameplay

When you first start up a new game, you'll be given the option to play the tutorial mission. If you skip it, then you'll be immediately brought to the [Hideout](#hideout).

The game will take place in an open world in which the NPCs, quests, and loot are procedurally generated.

* You will be given free-reign to explore the world at your leisure in what's called the **exploration phase**. During the exploration phase you can meet NPCs, do favors for them, find loot through legal or illegal means, or just kill people. It's really up to you. Keep in mind murder hoboing DOES have consequences...

* In order to complete the game, there's a series of scripted missions you have to beat, called "Raids". 

* In order to complete these raids you need to prepare, which is what the exploration phase is for. 

* Some raids have time frames you need to act within, while others are free to be done whenever you want.

# Mechanics

## Mercenaries

The core mechanic of this game is recruiting mercenaries to fight by your side when the need arises. 

However, a large majority of people are not terribly comfortable with, and may be hostile to, the idea of revolting. That means you must build a [reputation](#reputation) with them. The higher their reputation, the more likely they will accept your offer. 

Once recruited, mercenaries will have a [loyalty](#loyalty) stat that's equal to their reputation stat when brought onto the team.

Mercenaries do not exist in the world anymore once hired, and are "activated" from the Hideout between explorations/raids or put into different support slots

### Activating a Merc

When a Merc is activated, that means that, when ready, a new exploration phase will start where you take control of the merc. Items collected by you still go to the collective inventory accessible from the Hideout

### Passive Activites

During an exploration phase where they're not doing anything, you can select a passive activity for the merc to do:

* Weightlifting = 3% chance to increase Strength/Health stat
* Target Practice = 3% chance to increase Shooting stat
* Cardio = 3% chance to increase Agility/Health
* Casino = Chance to win money. Scales with agility/charisma
* Casino (cheating) = Higher chance to win money, but also with a chance to be [detained](#detained). Scales with Agility/Charisma
* Theft = Chance to steal some extra items, but with a chance to be detained. Scales with Agility/Charisma

### Specializations

Sometimes the merc you hired on is particularly good at a certain set of skills, this means they can be given a special task during an exploration phase that will provide you with some sort of passive benefit for the duration of that phase. 

## Combat

In combat you can utilize both melee weapons and ranged weapons. Each of their own unique points

## Hideout

The Hideout serves as a hub for you to manage your mercs and plan your next move. 

In some instances, your hideout may be compromised, and law enforcement will close in and attempt to raid you. When this happens, you must fight them off or be [detained](#detained)/killed, the latter of which results in a **Game Over**. Succeeding in fighting them off 


## Death

Death is permanent in this game. However, the game does not end unless the main character (you) die. Which means that getting your first few mercs is essential for a successful run of this game. 

## Stats

* Hit Points (HP) - Represents your health. When reaching zero, a calculation is made to determine if the mercenary dies or is rendered unconscious. (See [Unconscious](#unconscious))

* Stamina - Depletes when sprinting, jumping, or melee attacking. Regeneration scales with Health

* Balance Points (BP) - Represents your balance. BP reduces from getting damaged, and once it reaches zero your mercenary ragdolls for a time. Melee attacks have significantly stronger BP damage than bullets do (outside of the high caliber ones), so don't worry about getting cheesed down by a group of gunmen...but also a group of gunmen can kill you fast anyway. BP regenerates quickly after not being damaged for a time.

* Armor Points (AP) - Represents the health of any worn armor. Armor health is depleted by a large amount when pierced by a bullet or hit with a bladed melee weapon. If a bullet is deflected, damage is minimal

## Attributes

Attributes are listed on a scale from 10 to 20, with 10 being represented as "average" and the baseline for stat increases/decreases

* Melee:
    * +1 melee damage
    * +0.5% crit chance

* Shooting:
    * -2% recoil
    * +0.5% reload speed

* Health:
    * +2% maximum stamina
    * +2% BP damage resistance

* Agility:
    * +1% movement speed
    * +1% melee speed

* Charisma:
    * +2% discount at vendors
    * +1% to dialogue checks

In addition, there's a couple additional attributes that apply only to NPCs

* Reputation: Represents the NPCs opinion of the player character
* Loyalty: Represents a mercenaries loyalty to the cause
* Cowardice (hidden): The liklihood that the NPC will flee from combat when damaged or threatened. *HINT: This increases significantly when an NPC is armed.*

## States

You can get into various states depending on many possible factors. These can be both positive and negative

### MIA

A placeholder state for when your mercenary's gone unconscious mid-raid. You'll find out what state they're in the following day. In some cases, MIA leads to the character having been mugged (stripped of all carried items) and making their way home the following day.

### Unconscious

Happens when your mercenary's HP reaches zero with blunt damage.

What happens after getting knocked out also depends on who got the last hit in, unless law enforcement are in active pursuit of you, in which case the police condition applies.

* Police/Military - That mercenary is [Detained](#detained)
* Civilian; self-defense - The mercenary can either be detained, killed, or mugged.
* Civilian; aggressor - The character may be killed or mugged
* Hostile - Character is killed

### Detained

When detained, a mercenary is in police custody. Mercenaries stay in this state for a certain amount of time depending on the wanted level you had before 

[TBD]

## Item Quality

Quality is tied directed to cost in shops, chance to spawn in loot areas, and signified but a color around it in the inventory. Quality is NOT a signifier of how strong/good the item is.

* Common [1] | Light grey | Most mundane items and common melee weapons are in this category
* Uncommon [2] | Light green | Civilian firearms and unique melee weapons are in this category
* Rare [3] | Cyan | All fully automatic/illegal firearms fit into this catgory, as well as Police-issue items
* Epic [4] | Purple | Military-issue items fit into this category
* Legendary [5] | Yellow | Incredibly unique items are in this category, like easter egg items. Usually these can only be found in specific item pools

## Item List

### Generic

* **Dingdong** | N/A - *This is just a placeholder item*

### TwoHandFirearm

#### Assault Rifles

* **AK-762** | [3] - *One of the USSR's few good contributions. The AK-762 has been the strong-arm of underdog revolutionaries since the 1940s, a tradition that continues to this day thanks to its sturdy construction, powerful cartridge, and easy maintenance. However, its weight and recoil leave much to be desired.*
* **AK-545** | [3] - *A newer version of the AK that was made during the Cold War that used a newer, smaller cartridge.*
* **AK-48** | [4] - *The Russian Federation's rifle of choice for their troops. Part of a long line of derivatives of the original AK-762*
* M4A3 | [4] - *Standard issue rifle of the ROA military, based on the highly customizable and very balanced AR platform*
* M16 | [5] - *One of the oldest versions of the AR platform that can be found. First developed in the 1950s by the United States*
