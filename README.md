# Rage of the Urbanites - The ACAB FPS

It is 2054.

Due to a catastrophic failure in 2032 to regulate the global temperature via an experimental weather machine, Earth has now entered a new ice age. 

In the early years of the ice age, many nations around the world buckled under the new threat. Most survivors from the Global South (who were able to) had to migrate due to the worsened famine and instability, until they eventually became frozen wastelands devoid of most life. The first world nations survived mostly unscathed. However, the ticking time bomb that was the United States eventually burst. 

The nation's simmering alt-right plague came to a head when agitators joined forces with militias and high-ranking military officers, as well as other elected officials to forcibly coup the entire American government, instilling a new fascist regime called Neopublicans. Their first act was to rename the nation to the Republic of America, and replaced all state governments with cronies of their own given the power to rule with impunity.

The police forces, as expected, got worse as a result, with police brutality practically made legal against the ever larger poverty class.

You play as a disillusioned anarchist who recently lost their closest friend to a murder by one of these emboldened police officers. Through events I don't want to spoil, you decide to start a militia of their own and bring the power back to the people. 

# Raids [CONFIDENTIAL]

## Tutorial Raid 

* Protag Lock
* An optional (and skippable) mission that you can do at the beginning. This raid entails escaping jail after being arrested during a protest

## A New Home 

* Protag Lock
* Find an abandoned weather site
* This site is a dungeon that is inhabited by a cult that believes that the start of the Second Ice Age was a simulation and the weather sites hold the key to escaping it
* Once beaten, this site becomes your new hideout

## Retribution

* *"Get your revenge. Take down the Chief of Police and anybody who tries to stop you"*

## The Showdown 

* Protag Lock
* *"This is it. All your work is now finally going to pay off. Take that waste down"*
* You will be raiding the Presidental Palace and taking down Royland DerSantos
* This raid has high-tier enemies that can easily cut down the ill-prepared

# Difficulty [CONFIDENTIAL]

## Casual

*"An easier experience, but still challenging"*

* Main character respawns
* "Tired" and "Poisoned" effects are disabled
* Health regenerates to 30% over time
* Extra starting attribute points

## Intermediate

*"A good challenge for those familiar with FPSs"*

* Main character respawns
* Health regnerates to 10% over time
* Melee attacks require stamina

## Hardcore

*"The developer-intended way to play. Punishingly difficult to those unfamiilar with the game's mechanics"*

* Main character death means GAME OVER and save file deletion
* Some raids now must be completed within a certain time frame, with consequences for failure
* Health doesn't regenerate
* You regain stamina at a slower rate the less health you have

## Modifiers

### Melee Only

* Guns and ammunition are removed from all item pools
* Enemies use melee weapons instead of firearms
* Throwables are still available
* Recommended for players who want a less intense experience

### DOOM Mode (?)

* No reloading! All guns have a classic ammo system
* No aiming down sights (except with scopes)

# Mechanics

## Combat

HP/BP/AP Damage

* The HP/BP/AP damage done before any resistances

Damage Types

* Bludgeon, Pierce, Slash, Ballistic, Poison, Caustic, Fire, Explosive, Impulse
* Used for handling resistances/immunities

### Melee Exclusive

Block Strength

* This value is equal to parry strength
* No RNG here, this is skill-based
* Attempting to block a weapon with higher parry power than the blocker will result in a stagger with BP loss

Parry Strength

* When parrying a melee attack, if the parryer's weapon's parry strength is weaker than the attacker's, then the parry fails, acting as a blocked attack regardless of timing (this will be indicated by its own sound effect, as well as a different one )
* Equal parry strengths favor the parryer
* If the attack's parry power is higher by a factor of three, then the parryer loses significant BP

Crit Chance

* CRT = BASE + [LUCK](#luck-confidential) - 10 * 0.2 + [(MELEE - 10) * 0.5]
* Critical hits multiply the damage by the weapon's crit modifier

Crit Modifier
* Per weapon

### Firearm Exclusive

Accuracy (min/max)

* The minimum and maximum value for your aim to be offset just before firing a round, changing the direction it fires.
* This is adjustable from many factors, including ammo choice, Shooting stat, and the weapon itself

Headshot

* Headshots do 2x damage with all ammunition
* Ammo with the "MelonPopper" trait will make a head explode in one shot, instantly killing

## garBLOXD

garBLOXD is the hacked version of the Freedomnet operating system, which has its own hacked servers to bypass national surveillance

However, no security is perfect, and sometimes operatives from law enforcement or even the military get into this network. There's ways to catch them, but this requires vigilance...

There's several applications you can go to on the garBLOXD network for various tasks such as meeting people, purchasing goods, getting information, and more

All online networks are simulated with new content loading every 8 in-game hours

### The Hub

A forum for people to post their thoughts. You cannot post or comment, but what people post can offer insight into the world including helpful hints

[CONFIDENTAL] If I can figure out how to make it online, I will do it

### P0yntea Dr3amz

A drug network. Purchase stims

### The Dig Blick Emporium

Network for guns as well as 3D print schematics

## Mercenaries

### Activating a Merc

During exploration or a raid, you can either play as yourself, or you can play as one of your mercenaries.

### Stats

* Hit Points (HP) - Represents your health. When reaching zero, a calculation is made to determine if the mercenary dies or is rendered unconscious. (See [Unconscious](#unconscious))

* Stamina - Depletes when sprinting, jumping, or melee attacking. Regeneration scales with Health

* Balance Points (BP) - Represents your balance. BP reduces from getting damaged, and once it reaches zero your mercenary ragdolls for a time. Melee attacks have significantly stronger BP damage than bullets do (outside of the high caliber ones), so don't worry about getting cheesed down by a group of gunmen...but also a group of gunmen can kill you fast anyway. BP regenerates quickly after not being damaged for a time.

* Armor Points (AP) - Represents the health of any worn armor. Armor health is depleted by a large amount when pierced by a bullet or hit with a bladed melee weapon. If a bullet is deflected, damage is minimal.

### Attributes

Attributes are listed on a scale from 10 to 20, with 10 being represented as "average" and the baseline for stat increases/decreases. Every point under 10 is a -1 to the stat increases, while every point above 10 is a +1 to stat increases

#### Melee

* +1 melee damage
* +0.5% melee crit chance

#### Shooting

* +2% accuracy
* +0.5% reload speed

#### Health

* +2% maximum stamina
* +2% BP damage resistance

#### Agility

* +1% movement speed
* +1% melee speed

#### Charisma

* +2% discount at vendors
* +1% to dialogue checks

#### Luck [CONFIDENTIAL]

* 0.2% added to MOST random rolls

In addition, there's a few additional attributes that apply only to NPCs

* Reputation: Represents the NPCs opinion of the player character
* Loyalty: Represents a mercenary's loyalty to the cause
* Cowardice [CONFIDENTIAL]: The liklihood that the NPC will flee from combat when damaged or threatened. *HINT: This decreases significantly when an NPC is armed.*

### Legendary Attributes [CONFIDENTIAL]

For any attribute that's at level 20, you can continue training that attribute with a 1% chance (No luck scaling) to gain a legendary attribute. Only one legendary attribute can be acquired per character, and cannot be removed.

* Superhuman Strength (Melee) - You can no longer be handcuffed, you break out of them with ease

* Terra Shooter (Shooting) - 20% chance not to consume ammo for MOST guns

* Untappable Reserves (Health) - Infinite Stamina

* Cracked Egg (Agility) - You gain the ability to double jump

* Silver Tongue (Charisma) - All social checks automatically succeed

(Luck does not have a legendary attribute, as it is hidden and cannot be trained)

* Chance to be caught: 30 + gambling_difficulty + (Agility - 10) * 2 + (LUCK - 10) * 0.2

* Has a chance to result in death
* Chance to succeed: 100 - raid_difficulty + ((Agility - 10) + (Shooting - 10)) + (LUCK - 10) * 0.2

## Crime, Security, and Unrest

A super-secret extra attribute exists for each mercenary and the player character called **Crimes**

Crimes all have an amount of 

There are three primary classes of crime: misdemeanors, felonies, and affronts

### Misdemeanors

Misdemeanors are minor crimes that only increase [wanted level](#wanted_level) to 1. Law enforcement will call backup after a time if they fail to catch you, which will increase your wanted level to 2 points.

### Felonies

Felonies are major crimes that increase the wanted level to 3-5 points. Law enforcement will call for backup if some of them die, increasing the wanted level up until the max level. Avoiding capture from a felony gives you the outlaw debuff for a time

### Affront

Any crime against the State is automatically classified as an affront, these automatically give your character a permanent [Outlaw](#outlaw) debuff

Affronts are:

* Murder of a law enforcement officer, military personnel, public official, or prison guard. Claims of self defense are not accepted (LEO/MIL/POF/DOC Murder)

### Wanted Level

## Buffs/Debuffs

### Tired

Happens after 8 in game hours. Increases with intensity over time. Can be suppressed with drugs, but Tired V will kill you if not addressed. Reduces Stamina regen

### Poisoning

There's two types of poisoning, inhaled and lingering. 

* Inhaled poisons damage you for an amount per second while in an area contaminated by it.
* Lingering poisons can have various effects that last until the end of the raid/mission or if an antidote is taken 

### Outlaw

[TDB]

## Mercenary States

You can get into various states depending on many possible factors. These can be both positive and negative

### MIA

A placeholder state for when your mercenary's gone unconscious mid-raid. You'll find out what state they're in the following day. In some cases, MIA leads to the character having been mugged (stripped of all carried items) and making their way home the following day.

### Unconscious

Happens when your mercenary's HP reaches zero with blunt damage.

What happens after getting knocked out also depends on who got the last hit in, unless law enforcement are in active pursuit of you, in which case the police condition applies.

* Police/Military - That mercenary is [Detained](#detained)

* Civilian; self-defense - The mercenary can either be detained, killed, or mugged.

* Civilian; aggressor - The character may be killed or mugged

* Hostile - Character is killed

### Detained

When detained, a mercenary is in police custody. Mercenaries stay in this state for a certain amount of time depending on the wanted level you had before 

[TBD]

## Item Quality

Quality is tied directed to cost in shops, chance to spawn in loot areas, and signified but a color around it in the inventory. Quality is NOT a signifier of how strong/good the item is.

* Common [1] | Light grey | Most mundane items and common melee weapons are in this category

* Uncommon [2] | Light green | Civilian firearms and unique melee weapons are in this category

* Rare [3] | Cyan | All fully automatic/illegal firearms fit into this catgory, as well as Police-issue items

* Epic [4] | Purple | Military-issue items fit into this category

* Legendary [5] | Yellow | Incredibly unique items are in this category, like easter egg items. Usually these can only be found in specific item pools

Penetration chance follows this formula:

Pen% = 100 + (absorbtion) - percentage_ap_missing

Pen% CAN go over 100.
