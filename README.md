# Rage of the Urbanites - The ACAB FPS

It is 2054.

Due to a catastrophic failure in 2032 to regulate the global temperature via an experimental weather machine, Earth has now entered a new ice age. 

In the early years of the ice age, many nations around the world buckled under the new threat. Most survivors from the Global South (who were able to) had to migrate due to the worsened famine and instability, until they eventually became frozen wastelands devoid of most life. The first world nations survived mostly unscathed. However, the ticking time bomb that was the United States eventually burst. 

The nation's simmering alt-right plague came to a head when agitators joined forces with militias and high-ranking military officers, as well as other elected officials to forcibly coup the entire American government, instilling a new fascist regime called Neopublicans. Their first act was to rename the nation to the Republic of America, and replaced all state governments with cronies of their own given the power to rule with impunity.

The police forces, as expected, got worse as a result, with police brutality practically made legal against the ever larger poverty class.

You play as a disillusioned anarchist who recently lost their closest friend to a murder by one of these emboldened police officers. Through events I don't want to spoil, you decide to start a militia of their own and bring the power back to the people. 

# Gameplay

When you first start up a new game, you'll be given the option to play the tutorial mission. If you skip it, then you'll be immediately brought to the [Hideout](#hideout).

The game will take place in an open world in which the NPCs, quests, and loot are procedurally generated.

* You will be given free-reign to explore the world at your leisure in what's called the **exploration phase**. During the exploration phase you can meet NPCs, do favors for them, find loot through legal or illegal means, or just kill people. It's really up to you. Keep in mind murder hoboing DOES have consequences...

* In order to complete the game, there's a series of scripted missions you have to beat, called "Raids". 

* In order to complete these raids you need to prepare, which is what the exploration phase is for. 

* Some raids have time frames you need to act within, while others are free to be done whenever you want.

# Raids

* Tutorial Raid [Protag Lock] - An optional (and skippable) mission that you can do at the beginning. This raid entails escaping jail after being arrested during a protest.

* A New Home [Protag Lock] - Find an abandoned weather site. This site is a dungeon that is inhabited by a cult that believes that the start of the Ice Age was a simulation and the weather sites hold the key to escaping it. Once beaten, this site becomes your new hideout.

* Retribution - Blood for blood. Take out every officer present at the Metro District's police station and burn it down.

* The Showdown [Protag Lock] - The final raid. You will be raiding the Presidental Palace. This raid has high-tier enemies that can easily cut down the ill-prepared. 

# Mechanics

## Mercenaries

The core mechanic of this game is recruiting mercenaries to fight by your side when the need arises. 

However, a large majority of people are not terribly comfortable with, and may be hostile to, the idea of revolting. That means you must build a [reputation](#reputation) with them. The higher their reputation, the more likely they will accept your offer. 

Once recruited, mercenaries will have a [loyalty](#loyalty) stat that's equal to their reputation stat when brought onto the team.

Mercenaries do not exist in the world anymore once hired, and are "activated" from the Hideout between explorations/raids or put into different support slots

### Activating a Merc

During exploration or a raid, you can either play as yourself, or you can play as one of your mercenaries.

## Stats

* Hit Points (HP) - Represents your health. When reaching zero, a calculation is made to determine if the mercenary dies or is rendered unconscious. (See [Unconscious](#unconscious))

* Stamina - Depletes when sprinting, jumping, or melee attacking. Regeneration scales with Health

* Balance Points (BP) - Represents your balance. BP reduces from getting damaged, and once it reaches zero your mercenary ragdolls for a time. Melee attacks have significantly stronger BP damage than bullets do (outside of the high caliber ones), so don't worry about getting cheesed down by a group of gunmen...but also a group of gunmen can kill you fast anyway. BP regenerates quickly after not being damaged for a time.

* Armor Points (AP) - Represents the health of any worn armor. Armor health is depleted by a large amount when pierced by a bullet or hit with a bladed melee weapon. If a bullet is deflected, damage is minimal.

## Attributes

Attributes are listed on a scale from 10 to 20, with 10 being represented as "average" and the baseline for stat increases/decreases

* Melee:
    * +1 melee damage
    * +0.5% melee crit chance

* Shooting:
    * -2% recoil
    * +0.5% reload speed

* Health:
    * +2% maximum stamina
    * +2% BP damage resistance

* Agility:
    * +1% movement speed
    * +1% melee speed

* Charisma:
    * +2% discount at vendors
    * +1% to dialogue checks

In addition, there's a couple additional attributes that apply only to NPCs

* Reputation: Represents the NPCs opinion of the player character
* Loyalty: Represents a mercenaries loyalty to the cause
* Cowardice (hidden): The liklihood that the NPC will flee from combat when damaged or threatened. *HINT: This decreases significantly when an NPC is armed.*

## Legendary Attributes

For any attribute that's at level 20, you can continue training that attribute with a 1% chance to gain a legendary attribute. Only one legendary attribute can be acquired per character, and cannot be removed.

* Melee - You can no longer be handcuffed, you break out of them with ease
* Shooting - 20% chance not to consume ammo for MOST guns
* Health - +50 maxiumum health
* Agility - Can block bullets by blocking with a melee weapon with 2+ parry power at a BP cost
* Charisma - All social checks automatically succeed

### Passive Activites

During an exploration phase where they're not doing anything, you can select a passive activity for a merc to do:

* Weightlifting = 3% chance to increase Strength/Health. Requires a 1 day rest period
* Target Practice = 3% chance to increase Shooting. Costs an amount of money to spend on ammunition
* Cardio = 3% chance to increase Agility/Health. Requires a 1 day rest period
* Casino = Chance to win or lose money. Scales with Charisma
* Casino (cheating) = Higher chance to win money, but loss means getting [detained](#detained). Scales with Agility/Charisma
* Theft = Chance to steal some extra items, but with a chance to be detained. Scales with Agility/Charisma. Requires a 1 day rest period
* Scout = Can scout out a raid area for you to provide some basic details. Has a chance to result in death. Scales with Agility/Shooting. Requires a 1 day rest period

## Hideout

The Hideout serves as a hub for you to manage your mercs and plan your next move. 

## States

You can get into various states depending on many possible factors. These can be both positive and negative

### MIA

A placeholder state for when your mercenary's gone unconscious mid-raid. You'll find out what state they're in the following day. In some cases, MIA leads to the character having been mugged (stripped of all carried items) and making their way home the following day.

### Unconscious

Happens when your mercenary's HP reaches zero with blunt damage.

What happens after getting knocked out also depends on who got the last hit in, unless law enforcement are in active pursuit of you, in which case the police condition applies.

* Police/Military - That mercenary is [Detained](#detained)
* Civilian; self-defense - The mercenary can either be detained, killed, or mugged.
* Civilian; aggressor - The character may be killed or mugged
* Hostile - Character is killed

### Detained

When detained, a mercenary is in police custody. Mercenaries stay in this state for a certain amount of time depending on the wanted level you had before 

[TBD]

## Item Quality

Quality is tied directed to cost in shops, chance to spawn in loot areas, and signified but a color around it in the inventory. Quality is NOT a signifier of how strong/good the item is.

* Epic [4] | Purple | Military-issue items fit into this category
