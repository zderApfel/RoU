Hey everybody! I've been doing more experimentation and decided the FPS game I was looking to make wasn't the best vision I had for it. Instead ideas I had from it are being adopted into two other projects I'm working on!

So anyway with that being said, I have my FPS prototype here which an OOP (Object-Orientated Programming) setup allows you to create weapons extremely easily, all that's needed is a model and animations for all of them. The guns utilize a hybrid hitscan x projectile system. HOWEVER, the projectile system is not perfect, and I think it's due to limitations in Godot's physics engine. Basically unless you run the game at 120fps the bullets will "tunnel" if they move at a faster velocity than around 400 or so (testing provided inconsistent results). So tweaking and testing is needed for all weapons if you want to keep using projectiles. Switching to hitscan shouldn't be too hard with some script adjustments

I am offering this to you all free to use! That's right! Have fun with it, experiment, make a game out of it, make fun of my shit code, whatever you want!

I's not well documented in the code but for anybody who has questions about using it or modifying it I'm going to be available in this thread whenever I can to answer your questions!
