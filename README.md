# Rage of the Urbanites - A modern TBRPG

## Overview

Rage of the Urbanites will be a turn-based RPG in a modern setting. The story centers around the fictional nation of Dufonta, which is currently under rule of a theocratic fascist party, the “Purity Party”. The Purity Party is a party that focuses on squashing perceived moral decay. This results in strict laws governing personal liberties as they may contradict the party’s religious beliefs. Their initial victory was after the “Worker’s Party of Dufonta” was overthrown in a violent coup de tat that resulted in the execution of almost all the key party members.
The player takes the role of a struggling family man who recently lost their job. After responding to a cry for help one night, you find yourself part of a campaign far beyond anything you ever saw yourself doing. 

## Gameplay

### Attributes

Almost every NPC and enemy in the game has a set of attributes, including the player. These attributes affect various elements of gameplay, and sometimes affect player entities and enemy entities differently.

* **Strength**: Modifier for strength-based actions and melee attacks.

* **Agility**: Modifier for agility-based actions and ranged attacks

* **Vigor**: Modifier for resistance to damage and some effects.

* **Intellect**: Different uses depending on the entity

    For Players: Modifier for many specific things (see “Intellect” for more information)

    For Enemies: Modifier for “Intelligent Actions”


* **Personality**: Modifier for social actions. Also effects the “Taunt” action in combat.

* **Sanity**: Modifier for resistance to mental effects (such as insults)

* **Luck**: Modifier for critical hits and slightly affects all random actions. 

Attributes are listed on a scale of 1-20, where 1 is disabled-level, 10 is average, and 20 is nigh-superhuman. A score cannot go below 1 for any reason, but CAN be brought over 20 by specific means.

### Phases

Gameplay will revolve around two different “phases”: exploration and combat. 

#### Exploration Phase

In this phase, your character usually has full freedom to move around. In this state, your controls are very basic, with your basic movement keys and then the following actions, bound to their own buttons:

* "Talk”: If an NPC is nearby, you begin a conversation
* “Inspect”: You investigate the nearby area for anything of interest. Outside of obvious/required things, you can find random loot depending on where you investigate depending on your “INTELLECT” stat
* "Attack”: If an NPC or object is nearby that can be attacked, you do so. If it’s an NPC, combat starts with you automatically doing a basic attack with your equipped weapon. 
* “Menu”: Open the pause menu

#### Combat Phase

In this phase, your party and your opponents are placed on the left and right side of a vertical battlefield. In combat, the following happens in order:
* Opportunity attacks happen
* Initiative is rolled (influenced by AGILITY and VIGOR) to determine turn order. 
* Both sides start combat, each entity taking a turn. 
* On the player’s (left) side, you control your teammate’s moves when it’s their turn. 
* On the enemy’s (right) side, attacks are done randomly, with a chance to do an “Intelligent Action” (determined by the enemy’s INTELLECT”)
