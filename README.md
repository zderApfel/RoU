# Rage of the Urbanites - The ACAB FPS

It is 2054.

Due to a catastrophic failure in 2032 to regulate the global temperature via an experimental weather machine, Earth has now entered a new ice age. 

In the early years of the ice age, many nations around the world buckled under the new threat. Most survivors from the Global South (who were able to) had to migrate due to the worsened famine and instability, until they eventually became frozen wastelands devoid of most life. The first world nations survived mostly unscathed. However, the ticking time bomb that was the United States eventually burst. 

The nation's simmering alt-right plague came to a head when agitators joined forces with militias and high-ranking military officers, as well as other elected officials to forcibly coup the entire American government, instilling a new fascist regime called Neopublicans. Their first act was to rename the nation to the Republic of America, and replaced all state governments with cronies of their own given the power to rule with impunity.

The police forces, as expected, got worse as a result, with police brutality practically made legal against the ever larger poverty class.

You play as a disillusioned anarchist who recently lost their closest friend to a murder by one of these emboldened police officers. Through events I don't want to spoil, you decide to start a militia of their own and bring the power back to the people.

# Mechanics

## Combat

HP/BP/AP Damage

* The HP/BP/AP damage done before any resistances

Damage Types

* Bludgeon, Pierce, Slash, Poison, Shock, Fire, Explosive, Impulse, Frost
* Used for handling resistances/immunities

### Melee Exclusive

Block Strength

* This value is equal to parry strength
* No RNG here, this is skill-based
* Attempting to block a weapon with higher parry power than the blocker will result in a stagger with BP loss

Parry Strength

* When parrying a melee attack, if the parryer's weapon's parry strength is weaker than the attacker's, then the parry fails, acting as a blocked attack regardless of timing (this will be indicated by its own sound effect, as well as a different one )
* Equal parry strengths favor the parryer
* If the attack's parry power is higher by a factor of three, then the parryer loses significant BP

Crit Chance

* CRT = BASE + [LUCK](#luck-confidential) - 10 * 0.2 + [(MELEE - 10) * 0.5]
* Critical hits multiply the damage by the weapon's crit modifier

Crit Modifier
* Per weapon

### Firearm Exclusive

Accuracy (min/max)

* The minimum and maximum value for your aim to be offset just before firing a round, changing the direction it fires.
* This is adjustable from many factors, including ammo choice, Shooting stat, and the weapon itself

Headshot

* Headshots do 2x damage with all ammunition
* Ammo with the "MelonPopper" trait will make a head explode in one shot, instantly killing

## garBLOXD

garBLOXD is the hacked version of the Freedomnet operating system, which has its own hacked servers to bypass national surveillance

However, no security is perfect, and sometimes operatives from law enforcement or even the military get into this network. There's ways to catch them, but this requires vigilance...

There's several applications you can go to on the garBLOXD network for various tasks such as meeting people, purchasing goods, getting information, and more

All online networks are simulated with new content loading every 8 in-game hours

### The Hub

A forum for people to post their thoughts. You cannot post or comment, but what people post can offer insight into the world including helpful hints

[CONFIDENTAL] If I can figure out how to make it online, I will do it

### P0yntea Dr3amz

A drug network. Purchase stims

### The Dig Blick Emporium

Network for guns as well as 3D print schematics

## Mercenaries

### Activating a Merc

During exploration or a raid, you can either play as yourself, or you can play as one of your mercenaries.

### Stats

* Hit Points (HP) - Represents your health. When it's at zero, you die

* Stamina - Depletes when sprinting, jumping, or melee attacking. Regenerates automatically at a speed dependent on Health stat. In hardcore mode, the regeneration rate is reduced with the amount of HP missing

* Balance Points (BP) - Represents your mental balance. BP reduces from getting damaged. If this reaches zero, you are rendered helpless for a time. The amount of time helpless scales with ones [Health](#health) and [Mind](#mind)

* Armor Points (AP) - Represents the health of any worn armor. Armor health is depleted by a large amount when pierced by a bullet. If a bullet is deflected, damage is minimal.

### Attributes

Attributes are listed on a scale from 10 to 20, with 10 being represented as "average" and the baseline for stat increases/decreases. Every point under 10 is a -1 to the stat increases, while every point above 10 is a +1 to stat increases

#### Melee

* +0.5 melee damage
* +0.5% melee crit chance

#### Shooting

* -2% recoil
* +0.5% reload speed

#### Health

* +2% stamina recharge speed
* +2% BP damage resistance

#### Mind

* +1% chance to hack/lockpick
* +1% to dialogue checks to recall or know information

#### Charisma

* +2% discount at vendors
* +1% to dialogue checks to pursuade, intimidate, or lie. 

#### Luck [CONFIDENTIAL]

* 0.2% added to MOST random rolls

In addition, there's a few additional attributes that apply only to NPCs

* Reputation: Represents the NPCs opinion of the player character
* Loyalty: Represents a mercenary's loyalty to the cause
* Cowardice [CONFIDENTIAL]: The liklihood that the NPC will flee from combat when damaged or threatened. *HINT: This decreases significantly when an NPC is armed.*

### Legendary Attributes [CONFIDENTIAL]

For any attribute that's at level 20, you can continue training that attribute with a 1% chance (No luck scaling) to gain a legendary attribute. Only one legendary attribute can be acquired per character, and cannot be removed.

* Hand-to-Hand Expert (Melee) - All attacks can be parried

* Terra Shooter (Shooting) - 20% chance not to consume ammo for MOST guns

* Untappable Reserves (Health) - Infinite Stamina

* Cracked Egg (Mind) - You gain the ability to double jump

* Silver Tongue (Charisma) - All social checks automatically succeed

(Luck does not have a legendary attribute, as it is hidden and cannot be trained)

### Passive Activites

During an exploration phase where they're not doing anything, you can select a passive activity for a merc to do:

* Training - CQC Training (to increase Melee)

* Training - Target Practice (to increase Shooting; costs an amount of money to spend on ammunition)

* Training - Weightlifting (to increase Health)

* Training - Cardio (to increase Mind)

* Leisure - Club Life (to increase Charisma; chance to decrease Health)

* Leisure - Casino (chance to win or lose money; scales with Charisma)

* Crime - Casino (higher chance to win money, but runs with risk of detainment; scales with Charisma/Mind)

* Crime - Armed Robbery (chance to get money; scales with Charisma/Shooting)

* Crime - Burglary (chance to steal loot, with risk of detainment or death; scales with Mind/Shooting)

### Specializations

Rarely, the merc you hired on is particularly good at a certain set of skills. These skills give then extra abilities in the field. These specializations can also be trained, and there's no limit to how many you can have

Master Thief:

* Lockpicking is doublerolled, with a 20% chance to not consume a lockpick
* Requires: Mind 14, Charisma 12

## Crime, Security, and Chaos

**Crime** is any action considered illegal in the Republic of America (For a list of crimes possible to do in the game, check the following sections)

If a civilian witnesses you commit a crime and succeeds in reporting you to police, your wanted level will be set to a value dependent on the crime reported.

When your wanted level is above 0, police-type enemies will converge on the area and search for you. After a certain amount of time they will give up, except with a wanted level of 5, which will cause a constant police search for you

**Security** is an area-specific stat that signifies the amount of security in the city. This increases from player actions and will result in more law enforcement being present. Some areas do not have a security stat

[CONFIDENTIAL] **Chaos** happens when, after a time of security being at its maximum, the area splits up into factions and it becomes essentially a war zone. Businesses are closed, and a large majority of civilians are hostile. This state is irreversable for the area. Wanted level doesn't exist in a Chaos area

### Misdemeanors

Misdemeanors are minor crimes that only increase [wanted level](#wanted_level) to 1. Law enforcement will call backup after a time if they fail to catch you during a chase, at which will increase your wanted level to 2 points.

### Felonies

Felonies are major crimes that increase the wanted level to 3-5 points. Law enforcement will call for backup if some of them die, increasing the wanted level up until the max level. Avoiding capture from a felony gives you the [outlaw](#outlaw) debuff for a time

### Affront

Any crime against the State is automatically classified as an affront, these automatically give your character a permanent outlaw debuff

Affronts are:

* Murder of a law enforcement officer, military personnel, public official, or prison guard. Claims of self defense are not accepted (LEO/MIL/POF/DOC Murder)

## Buffs/Debuffs

### Tired

Happens after 8 in game hours. Increases with intensity over time. Can be suppressed with drugs, but Tired V will kill you if not addressed. Reduces Stamina regen

### Poisoning

Poisoning can cause various effects, and lasts until you rest or complete a raid

### Outlaw

[TDB]

## Mercenary States

You can get into various states depending on many possible factors. These can be both positive and negative

### MIA

A placeholder state for when your mercenary's gone unconscious mid-raid. You'll find out what state they're in the following day. In some cases, MIA leads to the character having been mugged (stripped of all carried items) and making their way home the following day.

### Unconscious

Happens when your mercenary's BP reaches zero and they are knocked unconscious

What happens after getting knocked out also depends on who got the last hit in, unless law enforcement are in active pursuit of you, in which case the police condition applies.

* Police/Military - That mercenary is [Detained](#detained)

* Civilian; self-defense - The mercenary can either be detained, killed, or mugged.

* Civilian; aggressor - The character may be killed or mugged

* Hostile - Character is killed

### Detained

When detained, a mercenary is in police custody. Mercenaries stay in this state for a certain amount of time depending on the wanted level you had before 

[TBD]
