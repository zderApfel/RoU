# Rage of the Urbanites - The ACAB FPS

![image](images/design_flowchart.png)

The core concept: It is 2050s America. Due to a catastrophic failure in 2032 to regulate the global temperature via an experimental weather machine, the Earth has now entered a new ice age. At the influx if this ice age, right-wing agitators joined forces with other militas and some high-ranking members of the US military to forcibly coup the entire American government, instilling a new fascist dictatorship. 

You play as a disillusioned anarchist who recently lost their closest friend to a murder-by-cop.  Through events I don't want to spoil, you decide to start a militia of their own and bring the power back to the people. 

Gameplay: The game is going to be a rogue-lite Tarkov-style FPS that takes place across multiple chapters, each taking place in partially-procedurally generated cities for you to explore, loot, and most importantly, find recruits. You can gain recruits by doing favors for them (which are usually illegal) and if their reputation with you is high-enough, they may just join you
