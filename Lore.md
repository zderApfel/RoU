# Background

## The United States of America

The former USA of this world is little different than the one that exists in our real world. All story-building present in the game will only refer to the time period of 2025 - 2032

### The Climate Catastrophe

The year 2025 came with the tragic but expected news that climate change was officially unfixable, and the planet was on a course to be unsustainable for human life by the mid 60s

However, an inventor by the name [Baron Flusk](#baron-flusk) wasn't ready to give up on humanity. With backing from most major world governments, Flusk oversaw the development of PROJECT NITROG; a drastic measure utilizing various weather stations around the world to fire an experimental Nitrog Laser into the atmosphere. The result was a drastic lowering of the world's temperature, to the point of a second Ice Age happening

During the development of this project, scientists and climate activists protested it, saying that further tampering with the atmosphere could be disasterous and our fate should be accepted with dignity and measured mitigation

Flusk was originally blamed directly for the catastrophe, but was able to dodge responsibility by being pardoned by the then President of the United States, [Royland DeSantos](#royland-desantos), who instead utilized the catastrophe to scapegoat the various "unpatriotic" and "degenerate" groups of the USA for sabotaging it, with little evidence to back it up

Flusk went on to continue his irresponsible and poorly-researched projects, with mixed success. Becoming the world's first million-millionaire and becoming the RoU's first and current Secretary of Scientific Development and Research

## The Republic of America

In 2032, with the endorsement of Royland DeSantos, right-wing militias acted in each of the 50 states to overthrow their state governors. This measure brought the formation of the Republic of America, with Royland naming himself the Forefather of the New Republic...or Forefather for short

In present day, the RoU has fallen from a collection of 50 unique territories to a snowy wasteland with only the largest cities remaining relatively unscathed. These cities are ruled by burgomasters that are free to act with impunity and are appointed by the Forefather

### The Neopublicans

The Neopublicans Core Values:

* Catholism is the national religion. As such, obedience to its laws and morals is enforced legally
* Direct involvement in government affairs by corporate entities
* The Forefather lives until his death, after which his chosen prodig√© will take over
* Crime is punished strictly and by a singular institution with no oversight
