* AK-762 | 1_1 - *One of the USSR's few good contributions. The AK-762 has been the strong-arm of underdog revolutionaries since the 1940s, a tradition that continues to this day thanks to its sturdy contstruction, powerful cartridge, and easy maintenance. However, its weight and recoil leave much to be desired.*
